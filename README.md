# Apt-Hunter

A Python-based tool to help you find apartments quickly in Seattle, WA. This project consists of two main components:

1. **Search Agent**: Scrapes apartment listings from apartments.com based on your criteria
2. **Classification Agent**: Uses GPT-4 to classify apartments by neighborhood for better geographical organization

## Features

- **Automated Apartment Search**: Scrapes apartments.com for listings matching your criteria
- **Customizable Search Parameters**: Filter by price, bedroom type, and more
- **Neighborhood Classification**: AI-powered classification of apartments by Seattle neighborhoods
- **Excel Output**: Results saved in easy-to-use Excel format

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Chrome browser (for Selenium WebDriver)
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4 classification)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Timber-Gu/Apt-Hunter.git
   cd Apt-Hunter
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas webdriver-manager openai
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key in `Classify_Agent.py`:
   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key_here"
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Search for Apartments

Configure your search parameters in `Search_Agent.py`:

```python
# Base URL for apartment search
TARGET_URL = "https://www.apartments.com/seattle-wa/"
# Maximum price filter for apartments
MAX_PRICE = 1600
# Keywords to filter bedroom types
BED_KEYWORDS = ["Studio", "studio", "1 bed"]
# Maximum number of pages to scrape
MAX_PAGES = 12
```

Run the search agent:

```
python Search_Agent.py
```

This will generate an Excel file (`apartments.xlsx`) with all matching apartments.

### Step 2: Classify Apartments by Neighborhood

Configure the classification settings in `Classify_Agent.py`:

```python
INPUT_FILE = "apartments.xlsx"  # The file generated by Search_Agent.py
OUTPUT_FILE = "apartments_with_neighborhoods.xlsx"
ADDRESS_COLUMN = "address"  # The column containing address information
```

Run the classification agent:

```
python Classify_Agent.py
```

This will generate a new Excel file with apartments classified by neighborhood.

## How It Works

### Search Agent

1. Uses Selenium to automate browsing apartments.com
2. Scrolls through pages to load dynamic content
3. Extracts apartment details (name, price, bedrooms, address, link)
4. Filters results based on your criteria
5. Saves matching apartments to an Excel file

### Classification Agent

1. Reads the Excel file generated by the Search Agent
2. For each apartment address, uses GPT-4 to classify it into one of 100+ Seattle neighborhoods
3. Sorts the results by neighborhood
4. Saves the classified data to a new Excel file

## Customization

- Modify `MAX_PRICE` and `BED_KEYWORDS` in `Search_Agent.py` to change search criteria
- Add or remove neighborhoods in `NEIGHBORHOODS` list in `Classify_Agent.py`
- Adjust `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `Classify_Agent.py` to improve classification accuracy

## Logging

The Search Agent includes logging functionality that saves information to `apartment_scraper.log`, which can be helpful for debugging.
